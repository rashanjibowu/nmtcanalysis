## Welcome!

This repository holds code, tools, and analysis to measure and explore how the New Market Tax Credit Program has deployed its funds since 2005. Our aim is to use data to answer several questions about this program?  

1. Did this program improve living conditions in the areas where capital was deployed?
2. Which geographies (states and zipcodes) were the greatest beneficiaries of the program?
3. Was the overall impact consistent among the various recipient geographies (states and zipcodes)? 
4. Into which geographies should capital under this program be deployed in the future?
5. Which CDFIs were most active in deploying capital?
6. Which CDFIs were most effective in deploying capital?
